# junit5-gradle-kotlin-template

The `junit5-gradle-kotlin-template` project demonstrates how to run tests based on
JUnit Jupiter using [Gradle's native JUnit Platform support], Gradle's Kotlin DSL
and code and tests written in Java & Kotlin and provides a better console reporting than the default one.

[Gradle's native JUnit Platform support]: https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/java_testing.html#using_junit5

Run `./gradlew test` to execute all tests.
